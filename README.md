That's AMAZING - we'd love to have you speak at HRNUG.  It's a really easy process.

## My company would like to sponsor Hampton Roads .NET
Excellent!  We can make that happen.  Currently, our only requirement for sponsorship is that you show up and feed a group of hungry software developers.  You can see the months that need sponsorship by looking for issues marked as `NEED SPONSOR`.
